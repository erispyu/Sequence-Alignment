1. Plot Design:
I have executed the basic version and the space efficient version sequence alignment on sequences with size 0 to 1299, and collect the corresponding CPU time usage and memory usage to generate the plot graphs.

2. Results and observations:
(1) The two version's time usage is growing in step with each other, while the space efficient version has a higher time usage.
(2) The memory usage is quite so different.
    The space-efficient version remains at a very low usage under 10000 KB.
    However, the basic version's memory grows very fast and become extremely large.
(3) One interesting fact is that when problem size step from 535 to 536, the memory usage drop from 9384 KB to 5584 KB, and then go on slowly growing.
    I think this case is caused by the fact that as the problem size grows, we have many common sub-problems, which can be reused.
